# BFS and DFS Algorithm in Directed Graph
---
## Description
- This C++ program is about implementing Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS) to traverse a directed graph. Here I implement DFS using iterative method. This program can perform traverse all nodes in a graph and traverse graph from starting node. The program then outputs the traversal order from BFS / DFS algorithm. This program also uses command line interface (CLI) to ask input and interact with the user.
